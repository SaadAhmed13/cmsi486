  primary key (Student_number)
 );

create table course
( Course_name   varchar(20),
  Course_number   varchar(20),
  Credit_hours    int,
  Department    varchar(20),
  primary key (Course_number)
);

create table prerequisite
( Course_number     varchar(20),
  Prerequisite_number varchar(20),
  foreign key (Course_number) references course(Course_number),
  foreign key (Prerequisite_number) references course(Course_number)
);

create table section
( Section_identifier  varchar(20),
  Prerequisite_number varchar(20),
  primary key (Section_identifier),
  foreign key (Prerequisite_number) references course(Course_number)
);

create table grade_report
( Student_number    int,
  Section_identifier  varchar(20),
  grade           char(1),
  foreign key (Student_number) references student(Student_number),
  foreign key (Section_identifier) references section(Section_identifier)
